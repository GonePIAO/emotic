### EMOTIC Dataset (Structure description)
#### All annotations (or ground truth) are stored as fields in _Annotations.mat_ (matlab structure file)
Each structure entry has all the information (including the annotation) about every person under consideration.   

    Annotations(1) = 
    
                      filename: '007eear5kx5qhbzewz.jpg'   
                        folder: 'emodb_small/images'    
                    image_size: [1x1 struct]    
       hasAnnotations_discrete: 'YES'    
     hasAnnotations_continuous: 'YES'    
             original_database: [1x1 struct]   
                        person: [1x2 struct]   

`original_database` field contains one of the four names of the original databases (`emodb_small`, `mscoco`, `ade20k` or `framesdb`.)
The person field above `[1x2 struct]` shows that the image has 2 people and the details about each person is stored in this field.  
For exapmple, the first person has the following information, 
```
Annotations(1).person(1) =

                     body_bbox: [215 111 580 352]
                     head_bbox: [228 118 318 231]
        annotations_categories: [1x1 struct]
        annotations_continuous: [1x1 struct]
            annotations_gender: [1x1 struct]
               annotations_age: [1x1 struct]
           estimated_body_bbox: [294 167 580 384]
estimated_body_bbox_confidence: 0.7692
           estimated_face_bbox: [263 111 437 227]
estimated_body_face_confidence: 'NA'
```
Each bbox has the format `[x1 y1 x2 y2]` - the four co-ordinates of the bounding rectangle.     
`estimated_body_bbox` field represents the body bounding boxes that were obtained after running body detector ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497)) with the corresponding confidence level (if available) `estimated_body_bbox_confidence`    
Similarly, `estimated_face_bbox` is the face bounding box estimated by the face (R-CNN) detector ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03473)) with the corresponding confidence level `estimated_body_face_confidence` for each person.   

The confidence level with which the bboxes were estimated is given by   
```
Annotations(1).person(1).confidence = 0.9
``` 

The emotion categories (ground truth) annotated by a annotator (AMT Turker) for a person is given by  
```
Annotations(1).person(1).annotations_categories = 
     
            worker_id: 'AHI8X7NP92DAV'
            work_time: 511
             batch_id: 2
           categories: {'Affection'  'Pleasure'  'Happiness'}
```
The continuous dimension annotations (ground truth) of a person by a given worker is shown by
```
Annotations(1).person(1).annotations_continuous = 

    worker_id: 'A3C8KN9HKGGZKG'
    work_time: 361
     batch_id: 128
      valence: 8
      arousal: 4
    dominance: 10
```
The gender of the person annotated by the worker is shown by
```
Annotations(1).person(1).annotations_gender = 

    worker_id: 'A3C8KN9HKGGZKG'
    work_time: 361
     batch_id: 128
       gender: 'Female'
```
The age of the person annotated by the worker is given by
``` 
Annotations(1).person(1).annotations_age 

    worker_id: 'A3C8KN9HKGGZKG'
    work_time: '361'
          age: 'Adult'
     batch_id: 128
```
